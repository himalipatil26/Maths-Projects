## 🧠 Overview
Matrix Operations Program is an interactive Python project for Class 11 students.
It allows users to perform basic matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, determinant calculation, and solving linear equations.

This project helps students understand linear algebra concepts practically and also improves Python programming skills.

Key functionalities include:
- Matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication
- Transpose of any matrix
- Determinant of a square matrix
- Optional: solve linear equations (Ax = b)
- User-friendly command-line interface

## ⚙️ Features

- Add, subtract, and multiply matrices
- Compute transpose of a matrix
- Calculate determinant of a square matrix
- Solve linear equations using NumPy (Ax = b)
- Interactive CLI (command-line interface)
- Optional: extendable for GUI or visualization
